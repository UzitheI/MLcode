#we can also choose a good learning rate to find out the cost function more properly 

#if the cost function plot is periodic, then the learning rate is very large 

#large learning rate can sometimes mean offshooting from the required value 

# values of alpha to try 0.001 0.01 0.1, 1

# with a difference of 3 

#find the largest possible alpha that doesnot create offshooting
